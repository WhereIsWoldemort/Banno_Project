Compilation and Run Instructions
--------------------------------
- to compile:
	1. move to "sources" directory (<directory_path>/Banno_Project/sources)
	2. type "javac Main.java -d ../classes"
- to run:
	1. move to "classes" directory (<directory_path>/Banno_Project/classes)

Known Issues
------------
> The getCharacterMap() method in the ExtendedString class is slow because it's analyzing every individual character in a large text file (the HTML document for banno.com). As a result, there is a little of a delay
with generating the top 3 alphanumeric characters.
